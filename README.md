# ultimatexo
An ultimate noughts and crosses game.

## Why?
Because ultimate noughts and crosses is fun, and I had never built a GUI
python application before.

## Shouldn't it be ultimateox?
Shh. I still pronounce it "ultimate noughts and crosses".

## You shouldn't have done X
Probably. Fix it and submit a pull request.
